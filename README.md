# rsvpmaker

* Create webinars and other online events leveraging free resources like the YouTube Live service.
* Use the Limited Time Content Gutenberg block -- a wrapper block that can include paragraphs, images, and other content -- to set a start and/or end time for the display of content. Useful for promoting events and limited time pricing on your home page or in the body of a blog post, without looking foolish if you forget to take down those promotions.

RSVPMaker is free and open source, with no upsell to a premium version. We occasionally create custom features on contract, but where possible those enhancements are folded back into the coe plugin code. RSVPMaker is also developer friendly, allowing you to build event-centric applications on top of it.

Creating and Managing Events

RSVPMaker events are created and edited just like blog posts in the WordPress editor, with the addition of parameters like event date (so the items can be listed chronologically and displayed on a calendar grid). Supports the Gutenberg editor as well as the classic WordPress editor.
